# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
As part of my personal professional development I have 'enrolled' in the MITOPENCOURSEWARE program. This repository contains some of the training material and my course work. The purpose of this repository is to expand on my experience and knowledge working with Python, Git, Github and learn best practices/ habits when programming.
